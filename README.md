# Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels. An important goal of clean architecture is to provide developers with a way to organize code in such a way that it encapsulates the business logic but keeps it separate from the delivery mechanism. This allows the business logic to be independent of the UI, the database, or any other external factors.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. You can read about TDD here.[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
